# Authentication and Role-Based Access Control Improvements

## Summary of Changes

I have implemented comprehensive JWT token validation and role-based access control to ensure that users can only access views that match their authenticated role. The system now properly validates both the JWT token content and the selected role during login.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Route Guards
Created four new guard files to protect routes:
- **AuthGuard** (`guards/auth.guard.ts`): Base authentication guard
- **TeamLeadGuard** (`guards/team-lead.guard.ts`): Protects team lead routes
- **BenchedEmployeeGuard** (`guards/benched-employee.guard.ts`): Protects benched employee routes
- **AdminGuard** (`guards/admin.guard.ts`): Protects admin routes

### 2. Enhanced Sign-In Component
Updated `sign-in-account.component.ts` with:
- **Role Consistency Checking**: Validates that the JWT token role matches the selected role
- **Better Error Messages**: Provides specific error messages for role mismatches
- **Token Validation**: Ensures tokens are cleared when validation fails
- **Cross-Role Detection**: Detects when users select wrong role for their credentials

### 3. Improved UserService
Enhanced `user.service.ts` with:
- **Role Validation Method**: `validateTokenForRole()` with better logging
- **Role Consistency Checker**: `checkRoleConsistency()` for role mismatch detection
- **Token Cleanup**: `clearAllTokens()` method for secure logout
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better validation and error reporting

### 4. Route Protection
Updated `app.routes.ts` to include guards on all protected routes:
- Team Lead View: Protected by `TeamLeadGuard`
- Benched Employee View: Protected by `BenchedEmployeeGuard`
- Admin View: Protected by `AdminGuard`

### 5. UI Improvements
Enhanced error message display in the sign-in component:
- Better styled error messages with background colors and borders
- Icon support for error messages
- More prominent display of role mismatch warnings

## How It Works

### Authentication Flow
1. **User Selection**: User selects their role (Team Lead or Benched Employee)
2. **Credential Validation**: System attempts login with appropriate endpoint
3. **JWT Analysis**: Extracts role information from returned JWT token
4. **Role Verification**: Compares JWT role with selected role
5. **Access Control**: Only allows access if roles match exactly

### Role Mismatch Detection
If a user selects "Team Lead" but enters "Benched Employee" credentials (or vice versa):
- The system will detect the role mismatch from the JWT token
- Display a clear error message explaining the mismatch
- Clear any stored tokens for security
- Prompt user to select the correct role

### Route Protection
- Direct URL access to protected routes is blocked by guards
- Guards validate both token presence and role authorization
- Invalid or expired tokens result in automatic logout and redirect to sign-in
- Role mismatches trigger immediate logout and clear error messages

### Error Messages
The system now provides specific error messages for different scenarios:
- **Invalid Credentials**: "Invalid email or password for [Role] access"
- **Role Mismatch**: "Role mismatch detected. You selected '[Selected Role]' but your account is registered as '[Actual Role]'. Please select the correct role."
- **Access Denied**: "Access denied. [Role] credentials required."
- **Token Issues**: "Unable to determine user role from authentication token."

## Security Features

1. **Token Validation**: All tokens are validated for expiration and integrity
2. **Role Enforcement**: Users can only access views matching their authenticated role
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: Invalid tokens are automatically removed
4. **Route Guards**: All protected routes require proper authentication and authorization
5. **Session Management**: Proper logout functionality clears all authentication data

## Testing Scenarios

To test the improved authentication:

1. **Correct Role Selection**: 
   - Select "Team Lead", enter Team Lead credentials → Should access Team Lead view
   - Select "Benched Employee", enter Benched Employee credentials → Should access Benched Employee view

2. **Incorrect Role Selection**:
   - Select "Team Lead", enter Benched Employee credentials → Should show role mismatch error
   - Select "Benched Employee", enter Team Lead credentials → Should show role mismatch error

3. **Direct URL Access**:
   - Try accessing `/team-lead-view` without authentication → Should redirect to sign-in
   - Try accessing `/benched-employee-view` with wrong role token → Should show access denied and redirect

4. **Token Expiration**:
   - Access with expired token → Should automatically logout and redirect to sign-in

The system now provides robust security while maintaining a user-friendly experience with clear error messages and proper role-based access control.
