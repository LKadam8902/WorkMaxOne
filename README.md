## ‚ö° Overview

WorkMax is a SAAS platform that effectively streamlines task assignment to benched employees.

## ‚ùì Why WorkMax?

It improves resource utilization across the organization and fosters greater transparency in **workload distribution** by efficiently tracking benched employee availability and skills. Ultimately, this leads to a **substantial reduction in benched duration** and a **notable boost in overall productivity**.

## üîë Key Features

- **Automatic Task-Benched Employee Matching**: Benched employees get automatically matched with available tasks based on bench duration and skillsets.
- **Scrum board type Task updation**: Benched employees can seamlessly update task progress.
- **Robust Security**: The Admin will be able to approve users.

## üèπ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Angular Js
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java 24)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
- **ORM**: JPA / Hibernate
- **API**: REST
- **Authentication**: Spring Security with JWT
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS, Railway (optional)

## üå≥ Project Structure

### Backend (backend/workmax)

- `model/`: JPA entities like `Employee`, `Benched Employee`, `Team Lead`, `Project`, `Task`, etc.
- `controller/`: REST API endpoints (Auth, Admin, Employee).
- `service/`: Business logic (`AuthService`, `BenchedEmployeeService`, `EmployeeRESTService`, etc.).
- `repository/`: JPA Repositories for database access.
- `security/`: JWT & OAuth2-based authentication setup.
- `config/`: Spring configuration (Cloudinary, Security).

### Frontend (frontend/my-angular-app)

- `components/`: All reusable UI and page components.
- `services/`: API communication logic.
- `context/`: Auth context provider.
- `assets/`: Images and static assets.
- `App.jsx`: Main app routing and structure.

```

### Backend Setup

Navigate into the backend directory and run the Spring Boot application:

```bash
cd backend/workmaxone/workmaxone
./gradlew bootRun
cd WorkMaxOne
```

### Frontend Setup
Navigate into the frontend directory, install dependencies, and start the development server:

```bash
