# Testing Authentication Flow

## Problem Description
The issue was that users could access views that don't match their role by:
1. Selecting "Benched Employee" in the radio button
2. Entering Team Lead credentials
3. Still accessing the Team Lead view

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced JWT Token Validation
- Added `checkRoleConsistency()` method to compare selected role with JWT token role
- Added detailed logging to track authentication flow
- Added `clearAllTokens()` method for secure cleanup

### 2. Route Guards
- Created guards for each protected route
- Guards validate both token presence and role authorization
- Automatic redirect and cleanup on validation failure

### 3. Component-Level Validation
- Enhanced `ngOnInit()` methods in view components
- Multiple layers of validation:
  - Token existence check
  - Token expiration check
  - Role extraction and validation
  - Service-level validation

## How to Test

### Test Case 1: Correct Authentication
1. Go to http://localhost:4200/sign-in
2. Select "Team Lead" radio button
3. Enter valid Team Lead credentials
4. Should successfully access Team Lead view

### Test Case 2: Role Mismatch Detection
1. Go to http://localhost:4200/sign-in
2. Select "Benched Employee" radio button
3. Enter Team Lead credentials
4. Should show error: "Role mismatch detected. You selected 'Benched Employee' but your account is registered as 'Team Lead'. Please select the correct role."

### Test Case 3: Direct URL Access
1. Try accessing http://localhost:4200/team-lead-view directly
2. Should redirect to sign-in page
3. After login with wrong role, should show access denied

## Debug Information

The console will now show detailed logs including:
- Selected role from UI
- JWT token analysis
- Extracted role from token
- Role consistency check results
- Validation success/failure reasons

## Backend Verification Needed

If the issue persists, check:
1. Are the backend endpoints `/auth/teamLead/login` and `/auth/benchedEmployee/login` returning different JWT tokens?
2. Do the JWT tokens contain the correct role information?
3. Is the role field in the JWT payload correctly set based on user type?

You can check this by looking at the browser console logs when attempting to login.
